                been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the
                world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari
                and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.
                Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical.
                The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of
                weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly
                circles.
                Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary
                to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender
                height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin
                x-height is set rather high.
